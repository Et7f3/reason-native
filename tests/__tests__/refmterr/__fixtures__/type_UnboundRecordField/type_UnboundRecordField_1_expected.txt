Record field [27m[24m[22m[1m[31mb[27m[24m[22m[39m can't be found in any record type.

Record fields must be "in scope". That means you need to `open TheModule` where the record type is defined.
Alternatively, instead of opening a module, you can prefix the record field name like {TheModule.x: 0, y: 100}.
